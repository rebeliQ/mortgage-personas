Bold, sans-serif typography (no pastels—use vibrant colors). SCIENCE: 45-90 min dwell = viewer sees ad 2-4 times minimum = Mere Exposure Effect activates (subconscious preference building). Show before/after payment comparisons, progress bars, numbers, savings calculations. Motion graphics STRONGLY preferred over static (attention already elevated from exercise). CRITICAL: Design for SOUND OFF (89% of gym screens mute). Include prominent CTA/QR code. Use aspirational imagery: active, healthy lifestyle overlaps with financial wellness.",
    creativeNotes: "RESEARCH: Gym-goers are motivated, goal-oriented = 'I can achieve this' mindset active. Use achievement language ('Own your goals'). Morning viewers (6-8 AM) in planning mode = highest receptivity. Studies show workout endorphins = positive associations transfer to brands seen during exercise. Multiple exposures per visit = each workout reinforces brand recall. Audio optional but use dynamic music if available.",

SCIENCE: 3-5 min viewing = can show complete story arc (Problem→Solution→CTA). Use bold text, high contrast. Animation works (counter ticking down, calculator). 7 words for main message, can add secondary info due to long dwell. QR code at eye level = phones already in hand.",
